# Optimizing Ruby on Rails: My Strategy for Simplified Controller Logic with Stimulus Rails Autosave

In the realm of software development, venturing into the less conventional paths can sometimes reveal the most efficient and elegant solutions. Today, I’m excited to share my experience with a unique edge scenario in Ruby on Rails. This particular challenge involved a form integrated with the Stimulus Rails Autosave component, and the solution I devised might seem unconventional at first glance, yet it was perfectly suited for the task at hand. Let’s explore the code that made this possible and the thought process behind my approach.

## The Challenge at Hand

The task was straightforward yet nuanced: to manage the creation or deletion of a `FindingArea` object in response to user interactions, all within a form leveraging the Stimulus Rails Autosave component. The solution needed to be efficient, clean, and maintainable.

### The Code

Here’s the Ruby on Rails code snippet that stands at the core of the solution:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class V2::Assessments::FindingAreasController < ApplicationController
  def create_or_destroy
    options = {"true" => :create, "false" => :destroy}
    choice = params[:finding_area][:persist]
    send options[choice] || :bad_request
  end

  def create
    FindingArea.create(finding_id: params[:finding_id], area_id: params[:area_id])
    head :no_content
  end

  def destroy
    @finding_area = begin
      FindingArea.find_by(finding_id: params[:finding_id], area_id: params[:area_id])
    rescue
      nil
    end

    if @finding_area&.destroy
      head :no_content
    else
      head :bad_request
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This code showcases the method I adopted to dynamically handle the creation or destruction of `FindingArea` instances, based on the user’s input, all within a single controller action.

### My Thought Process

The integration with the [Stimulus Rails Autosave](https://www.stimulus-components.com/docs/stimulus-rails-autosave) component offered two paths:

1. Directly instructing the controller to either create or destroy a `finding_area`.
2. Employing a `turbo_stream` to ascertain the required controller action and path, based on the `finding_area`.

I opted for the first route for several reasons:

- **Clarity**: Directly linking user actions to controller responses allowed for a transparent and straightforward flow.
- **Simplicity and Maintainability**: This approach resulted in cleaner and more manageable controller logic, essential for the longevity and scalability of the application.

Although this method slightly strays from the Rails conventions, it resonated with the application's requirements and the Stimulus Rails Autosave's functionality, striking a balance between simplicity and efficiency.

## Reflecting on the Solution

Choosing an unconventional path in Rails was a testament to the flexibility and adaptability required in software development. This experience reaffirmed that sometimes, the most straightforward solutions, though atypical, can be the most effective. The key takeaway from this journey is the importance of tailoring solutions that align with the specific needs of the application while ensuring code clarity and maintainability.

In the landscape of software engineering, such instances serve as valuable learning opportunities, encouraging us to think outside the box and approach problem-solving with an open mind. Ultimately, it’s about finding the balance that best suits the unique demands of your project, ensuring that the code remains elegant, functional, and straightforward.
